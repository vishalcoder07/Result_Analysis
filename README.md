# 📌 Result Analysis  

## 🚀 Overview  
**Result Analysis** is a web application developed using **ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB** to automate the **result processing** and **analysis** for colleges.  

Traditionally, faculty members manually enter **student results** from PDFs into **Excel sheets**, consuming **7 days** for **data entry** and **analysis**. This application **automates the process**, reducing it to just **5 minutes** using **ConvertAPI** for **PDF-to-CSV conversion** and provides **instant result insights**.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ **Automated PDF Processing**: Extracts data from result PDFs using **ConvertAPI PDF-to-CSV**.  
✅ **Batch-Wise Analysis**: Generates **Excel reports** for **entire student batches** within minutes.  
✅ **Subject-Wise Insights**: Identifies **subject toppers, failing students, and ATKT cases** instantly.  
✅ **Comprehensive Reports**: Displays **student performance metrics**, including **pass percentages** and **rank lists**.  
✅ **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Interactive UI for faculty to **upload PDFs**, analyze results, and download reports.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
The application follows a **modular approach**, integrating **frontend, backend, and database** components:  

### 📌 Workflow  
1️⃣ **Upload Result PDF** → Faculty uploads the **result PDF**.  
2️⃣ **Data Extraction** → ConvertAPI **extracts data** and stores it in **MongoDB**.  
3️⃣ **Batch & Subject Analysis** → Users can select a batch/year/subject for insights.  
4️⃣ **Excel Report Generation** → Downloadable **Excel reports** for academic analysis.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
